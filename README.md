# LHD-LEARN-2022-BOT

# What it does

The bot displays the LHD: Learn workshops and their links to check in. It also displays the introduction of LHD, how to use the bot, and frequent problems that participants face during LHD.

# How we built it

Use Autocode to build Discord bot and web scrapping API, Crawler Query API, to scrape the workshops' name and their links. If you go to 'References' section, you will see how to use the API on Autocode. Also built with blood and sweat

# Challenges we ran into

First time using Autocode to build Discord bot and also first time using Crawler Query API for web scrapping. Took really long time to learn and build

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

First time built Discord bot successfully!

# What we learned

Learnt how to build Discord bot using Autocode and use Crawler Query API for web scrapping. API stands for Application Programming Interface, is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. In order to web scraping the data on Local Hack Day site, the API needs to communicate with the website to extract necessary information and return the information back to the API and display the information on Discord bot.

# What's next for Learn about APIs

If it's possible, would also love to add challenges
